***** NUMERICAL METHODS IN MATLAB *****

This is a collection of Matlab code of several numerical algorithms, their application and examples of using Matlab built-in functions. The code is mainly following the undergraduate course "Mathematical Methods" taught in the industrial engineering curriculum at the University of Seville. 

The application examples are divided into the following topics:

T2: Linear equation systems
T3: Interpolation
T4: Numerical integration 
T5: Convex optimisation
T6: Ordinary differential equations

The implemented algorithms include:

- Centered difference (first and second order), gradient and Hessian
- Newton's method (optimization)
- Gauss-Newton method for non-linear least squares
- Euler's method, Euler's mid-point method, and the Runge-Kutta method for solving ordinary differential equations
